# -Density Based-traffic-surveillance-system

In this system we are allotting time based on density of traffic in each lane. If number 
of vehicles in a lane is more then time allotted will be more. This reduces time and 
also avoids traffic jams. This system uses OpenCV as a software, and uses the concept 
of Image Processing. The language that will be used is python. Instead of depending 
on information generated by costly sensors, economic situation calls for using 
available video cameras in an efficient way for effective traffic congestion estimation. 
Speaking about the feasibility, since we are using OpenCV as the software, the entire 
cost of the project is minimized.
